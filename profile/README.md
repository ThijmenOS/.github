**Note: ThijmenOS is a work in progress project and this documentation may change**
A fully functioning operating system written with play html, css and typescript

The ThijmenOS operating system started with an idea to make a operating system like portfolio website, then I tought how cool would it be to execute code on here and from the one came the other and I started developing a fully functioning browser based operating system.
## Components
The ThijmenOS project makes use of multiple modules to simplify the development process. These modules are hosted with NPM as packages.
